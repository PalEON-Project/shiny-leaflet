Methods:
-----------------------------------------
Details on the tree composition data from the Public Land Survey and Town Proprietor Surveys and processing of that data are provided in Goring et al. Details on the statistical modeling used to estimate composition with uncertainty on all grid cells in the domain are provided in Paciorek et al. The quantities plotted in the Shiny app and provided via the download option are posterior means and posterior standard deviations produced by the statistical modeling. Individual posterior draws that can be used to summarize the posterior can be obtained as described in Paciorek et al. The input data used in the statistical modeling can be obtained as described in Goring et al. and Paciorek et al. 

Data description:
-----------------------------------------
The data here are presented by taxon. Taxa represent groupings of species based on the original survey data as described in Paciorek et al. and Goring et al.  Supplement 2 of Goring et al. provides a full description of the taxonomic groupings used in this analysis.

All data is provided in a Great Lakes St Lawrence Albers projection.  The projection is identified as EPSG:3175, or as the proj4 string: “+proj=aea +lat_1=42.122774 +lat_2=49.01518 +lat_0=45.568977 +lon_0=-83.248627 +x_0=1000000 +y_0=1000000 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs”  Full details on the projection are available at SpatialReference.org: http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/nad83-great-lakes-and-st-lawrence-albers/

Raster files include both the mean and standard deviation of the posterior draws as part of a GeoTIFF raster stack with projection information embedded within the raster.

The CSV files include columns for x and y coordinates, taxon (repeating within each download),the mean and sd of the posterior draws and the projection.  The projection is reported only in the first row, and is the Great Lakes St Lawrence Albers (epsg:3175) for all downloaded files.
